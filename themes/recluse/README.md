# Hugo theme Recluse

Recluse is a minimal and fast theme for Hugo and a minor alteration of the
[Hermit theme](https://github.com/Track3/hermit). It's built for bloggers 
who want a simple and focused website.  

There are a few ways Recluse differs from Hermit:  

* highlight.js is used for syntax highlighting, making it compatible with
blogdown  
* More space between bullet points list items.  
* The navigation bar is always visible.  
* Has MathJax enabled by default.  


## Installation

Run this command from the root of your Hugo directory (Git needs to be 
installed):


```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wfondrie/recluse.git themes/recluse
```

For configuration details, refer to the original 
[Hermit documentaiton](https://github.com/Track3/hermit)
