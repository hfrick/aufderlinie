I work as a software engineer on the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) team at RStudio. Previously I've done data science consulting and teaching at [Mango Solutions](https://www.mango-solutions.com/). 

My background is in statistics and interdisciplinary research: my PhD project at Universit&auml;t Innsbruck was on the intersection of statistics, psychometrics, and statistical computing and my PostDoc at University College London was in cooperation with Team GB Hockey in preparation for the 2016 Rio Olympics.

I am a co-founder of [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org) and a former co-organiser of the London chapter.
